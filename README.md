# Acrypto - Weighted strategy 

I have been developing a fully customizable algo over the last year. The algorithm is based on a set of different strategies, each with its own weight (weighted strategy). Currently it has implemented a set of 5 strategies:

* MACD
* Stochastic RSI
* RSI
* Supertrend
* MA crossover

Moreover, the algo includes STOP losses criteria and a taking profit strategy. The algo must be optimized for the desired asset to achieves its full potential. The 1H and 4H dataframe give good results. The algo has been tested for several asset (same dataframe, different optimization values).

Important note:
Backtest the algorithm with different data stamps to avoid overfitting results

Best,
Alberto
